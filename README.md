# BasketballGame
Project Summary

In this assignment, we created an arcade basketball game. There are four components of the game. 

In this program there is a ball class that details the code entailed with the basketball object and its movement, a hoop class that moves a hoop side to side, a scoreboard class that updates the score image, and a confetti class that emits confetti after the user scores. 

File Structure

Ensure all these .pde files are in the same directory:

assigment5.pde

confettiparticle.pde
scoreboard.pde

hoop.pde

ball.pde

ball_texture.png

hoop_texture.png

When you have all the files attached run the code. 

Launch Processing.
Go to File -> Open... and navigate to the directory containing the sketch files.
Select assignment5.pde and click Open.

Press the triangular "Run" button in the toolbar at the top of the Processing IDE to run the sketch and view the animation.
